    <p><img alt="Bruno Best Builds MLBB Mobile Legends Bruno Guide" src="https://gamingonphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bruno-Builds.jpg" width="100%" height="" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Swift Boots:&nbsp;</strong>Bruno needs attack speed items to deal damage. Its passive gives an extra 15% attack speed.</li>
      <li><strong>Beserker&rsquo;s Fury:&nbsp;</strong>Bruno deals high critical damage. This item is one of the core items for Bruno because it increases crit chances. This helps to burst down enemies with basic attacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Endless Battle:&nbsp;</strong>Another core item for Bruno. Bruno&rsquo;s skills consume a lot of mana in the early game. You will find yourself running out of mana very quickly. So it is better to buy one or two magic necklace in early game to maintain his mana. That&rsquo;s why EB is a great item and it gives life a lot of lifestyle.</li>
      <li><strong>Malefic Roar:&nbsp;</strong>It is one of the best items in the late game for Physical Damage dealing heroes. Malefic Roar increases Physical Penetration if the enemy has high physical defense items. This item works great with Bruno&rsquo;s first skill.</li>
      <li><strong>Scarlet Phantom:&nbsp;</strong>It is a very good item for Bruno because he needs attack speed items. And it gives more critical changes and extra physical attacks. Looks like a complete package for Bruno.</li>
      <li><strong>The Final Item:&nbsp;</strong>This depends on the enemy lineup or game situation. If the enemy has high physical burst damage.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>You can build&nbsp;<strong>Wind of Nature.&nbsp;</strong>It is a great item to save yourself, its passive makes you immune to all physical attacks for a few seconds and gives lifestyle along with attack speed. But if the enemy has high magic damage heroes then build&nbsp;<strong>Athena Shield&nbsp;</strong>to avoid getting busted. You can also buy Immortality which can give you a chance to escape.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mobile Legends Bruno Gameplay Tips</h2>
    <p>Bruno is a skilled marksman, and one of the most popular ones in-game. However, a player must need a&nbsp;<strong>good understanding of the map</strong>&nbsp;to bring the best out of any hero. According to his gameplay, we can break it down into three phases. Our Mobile Legends Bruno guide includes the perfect game plan for the early, mid, and late game.</p>
    <h3>Early Game</h3>
    <p>Bruno&rsquo;s early game damage is not that high. It is recommended to go to the Gold lane as a late-game marksman. You have to play safe and passive, avoid getting ganked very early, it will slow down your farming speed. Always try to last hit the minions to get extra gold. This will help you to have some advantage in the laning phase. Use any chance to hit the enemy tower before 5 minutes to get extra gold from the turret shield.</p>
    <p><img alt="bruno early gameplay Mobile Legends Bruno Guide" src="https://gamingonphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bruno-early-gameplay.jpg" width="100%" height="" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Mid Game</h3>
    <p>At this point, you probably have your two core items ex Windtalker and Endlessbattle with these two items you can deal very good damage. As an offlane marksman, your primary objective is to push the lane or turrets whenever there is a chance. You have to develop good map sense in order to push lane without getting ganked. But if your team is falling behind, try to help them in a team fight, you must maintain your position to deal damage.</p>
    <h3>Late Game</h3>
    <p>Bruno is insanely strong at the late game. With the proper full build, Bruno can deal massive damage. It is the most important game of the game, try not to get ambushed, and always stay behind your team. With full stacks on first skill and ultimate combo, Bruno can wipe out the whole enemy team with good positioning.</p>
    <p>Bruno is item dependent hero, so you will need a decent farm to play aggressively and he is very strong in the late game. Bruno can take down high physical defensive heroes and can easily burst down squishy heroes. Bruno is a very easy-to-use marksman, so it won&rsquo;t be very difficult to master Bruno.</p>
    <p><img alt="bruno late gameplay mlbb Mobile Legends Bruno Guide" src="https://gamingonphone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bruno-late-gameplay.jpg" width="100%" height="" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although Bruno can deal huge damage in the late game, he is still very squishy. When you are out of position you can get burst down in no time also he is very weak against cc skills. That&rsquo;s it for Bruno. Keep practicing with him you will improve a lot faster.</p>
    <h3>Skill Combos&nbsp;for Bruno</h3>
    <p>Bruno is mostly dependent on his basic attacks like any other marksman. In order to deal the most damage in a team fight, you have to keep his stacks full before joining the team fight. Use your ultimate if the enemies are grouped together, this way your ultimate will continue to bounce onto multiple enemies and deal more damage. Remember, always try to keep his stacks up, this is very important for him</p>
