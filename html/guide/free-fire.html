	<p>This M1014 Free Fire Skin is indeed quite good, but a lot of players underestimate this weapon because it only has one attribute enhancer, different from other M1014 weapon skins available in the game. However, the main advantage of this gun is there&rsquo;s no reduction of other attributes at all.</p>

	<h4>Attributes</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>+Damage</li>

	<h4>Attributes</h4>

	<p>Unlike other legendary skins, the&nbsp;<strong>Green Flame Draco</strong>&nbsp;has another extra power, it provides extra damage when firing at&nbsp;<strong>Gloo Walls</strong>. You should be able to penetrate enemy walls with ease using this gun, especially in combination with Xayne&rsquo;s character ability.</p>

	<h2>How to use the M1014 gun in Free Fire</h2>

	<p>In Free Fire, movement is of top importance and when you are using a shotgun it is even more important than your time and managing your fighting Skills. When you are engaged in a fight in a closed area then use the reverse jump drag and fire to decrease the distance between you and the opponent. This will make it easier for you to use the attributes of your gun skins.</p>

	<h3>1. Make sure to use the Double Stock attachment</h3>

	<p>When you are using a shotgun in Free Fire always remember to put on the double stock attachment. This will significantly reduce the recoiling for M1014 which results in more accurate and more penetration hence more kill.</p>

	<h3>2. Learn to manage Recoil Control</h3>

	<p>It is difficult to manage recoil control in M1014 in Garena Free Fire. If your recoil control is&nbsp;<strong>still</strong>&nbsp;not proper then use this trick. When firing at an opponent, instead of continuous firing use movement to break the fire pattern and regain your aim. Movement under a cover of a gloo wall will give you protection and just a few seconds to reset your aim as well.</p>

	<h3>3. Always use the Shotgun in short-range</h3>

	<p>Now this one is more important while using the M1014 in a fight. Since the gun is SG-based, it is not good to use it for long-distance fights with the opponents. So always remember to maintain a distance of at least 10 to 15 meters and not above while using shotguns in the game. Shift to an AR or Sniper if you have to take a long shot.</p>
