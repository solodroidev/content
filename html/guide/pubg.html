    <h6>The new map, Troi</h6>
    <p>The game will also boast a new map, called&nbsp;<strong>Troi</strong>, as well as the classic&nbsp;<strong>Erangel</strong>&nbsp;map from the original game albeit with some changes. The training grounds mode, as well as the deathmatch mode from the original game, are also set to return.</p>
    <p>The game had already surpassed 20 million pre-registrations by July 2021 in the Google Play Store alone. Krafton expects these numbers to only improve further over the course of the game&rsquo;s life cycle.</p>
